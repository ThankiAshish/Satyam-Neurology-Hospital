												<p>Dr Prakash is very straightforward & concerned at the same time with patients. His promptness is appreciative. He was the first neurologist I met for my mother's case and I found him kind, attentive, honest & brilliant. Also, he listens to patients & their relatives carefully and is never in a rush no matter what time it is especially during the OPD hours. Thank you so much for your honest guidance & true opinions regarding my mother's health. Truly grateful to you.</p>
